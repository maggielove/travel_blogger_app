# Approach Taken 

I started by wireframing the various views I wanted for my app. Then I diagrammed the relationships between my models to determine which active record associations to use.

I managed the sessions and session personalization using bcrypt and ternary operators. Late in the project, I stumbled upon the Devise gem--would be interested to figure out if that would give me more personalization options once a user is logged in.

# Ideas to Further This App 

* Attach pictures to comments (similarly to the way I currently have authors assigned) that match a user's profile picture. 
* Give the user the ability to "like" a post
* Set it so that the "Featured Stories" on the homepage are the posts with the most likes. 
* Set it so that the Top Destinations listed on the homepage are either based on most liked posts or user surveys asking which cities they'd like to read about. 
* Give post creators the opportunity to assign categories to their posts (via drop-down list), such as "food" or "art". This way, users could search for a post based on category, city, or both. 
* Give the post creator the opportunity to add random tags.
* When users are adding a city to their post, give them a drop-down list to select from so that they won't accidentally make a typo, making it difficult for users to find their post. 
* Organize cities by continent 
* Organize cities on the homepage alphabetically. 
* Make the site searchable.
* Make it so that if there is only one article on a city, and that article is deleted, when the user gets to that city's page there is a note to the effect of, "We're sorry, there are currently no posts about X. {Interested in writing one?}"
* Improve the nav bar
* For user profile page: add "Member Since [join date]"
* Give users the option to edit or delete their accounts.
* Style the new post form so users don't have to drag the post body box to make it bigger. 
* Make it so that when a user logs in, they are directed to the page they were wanting to visit (ex: a new post form or an edit form), instead of to the home page.
* Make it more responsive for mobile
